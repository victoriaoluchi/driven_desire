    <h1>Driven Desire.</h1>

    <p>Desire without Drive is just in the head…just like it is one thing to want something and another to need something. Want on one hand is “Wow, that looks so good and wait it would certainly look better on me though, what if it is mine?” just the ‘Desire’ for or to become something. Need on the other hand is “Yes, that is me, that is definitely me” a ‘Drive’ and not just a ‘Desire’.</p>
    <p>Want, a mere feeling that is already programmed to fade. Desire, first time feeling but yet so easily forgotten, strong but yet weak, long-lasting but yet short-existing, famous but yet unknown, beautiful but yet ugly, solid but yet shallow, sight-to-behold but yet blurry. “I once desired to be a pilot”. Everyone at one point in life once pictured  time where they were “Who they always desired to be, who they wanted to be” Desire, just like a crave or wish is programmed to last but for a short time, before you know it…boom! It is gone. Desire, just like every other mere feeling, eventually fades off; love, hate, happiness, sadness, anger, calmness, tired, stressed, strong, weak, active, depressed, eventually gets coupled up with a verb in its past form no matter how long it may last.</p>
    <p id="note">Desire becomes more vivid and accomplished when coupled up with Drive.</p>
    <p>What then is Drive?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Drive, a visualizing reality, living wish, existence in non-existing, vividness in imagination. Drive, boom! that ‘Explosive Force’, force to become, force at which in the normal human eyes is just “Result-in-process” but in the Driven Eyes, Job-well-done.</p>
    <p id="story">Two men; Mr.  D and Mr. D are to race to a certain distance. While Mr. Desire moves with the picture of the final destination, goes on but his movement is capacitated, he keeps on moving depending just on his pace he then becomes weary and tired, slowly losing track and vision of what the image of the final destination looks like and then on the other hand is Mr. Drive, moving with an active force backing up his movement even when he gets weary or tired, his pace is backed up with an “Explosive Force”. A man that is driven moves far ahead of a man with desires and brings things to reality than just picturing them. It’s obvious who the winner of the race is.</p>
    <p>Another man Mr. DD joins in the race, here comes “The Super Human”, a man who has migrated from the level of a normal Human up to a level of a Super human. In the tip of his fingers lies the reality of great possibilities because he was initially a desiring man but now, he’s been Driven. Snap! things begin to come to play in an extraordinary manner. In reality, looks like ‘Work in progress’ but in Driven Visuality, ‘Mission accomplished!’. . </p>
    <p style="position: sticky;">While a Driven man moves far ahead of a Desiring man, a man with Driven Desire makes it to the destination before the Driven man. Yes, of course, Drive is a Force after all but coupled up with Desire, it is an Aweing Effect that keeps minds in wonder. With More, You Can Become More.</p>
